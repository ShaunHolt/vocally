# Vocally

 A friendly wrapper around the Web Speech API (VoiceRecognition and VoiceSynthesis) for JavaScript.

 The Web Speech API includes two main parts:

 - [SpeechSynthesis][] - teaching your page to talk. Works in most modern browsers.
 - [SpeechRecognition][] - teaching your page to listen. Currently Chrome only, but can be polyfilled with commercial APIs.

 Vocally is an easy to use JavaScript API for interacting with both.

### Getting support

Please open an issue on Github if you need help using Vocally.

### Contributing

I would love help in the following areas:

- Creating documentation and examples
- Pull requests - help us build the project!
- Setting up continuous integration and cross-browser tests

If you're a junior developer and would like to contribute, but are not sure where to start - ask me, via email (jason@jasono.co) or by opening a Github issue to discuss.

### The name

I chose the name because it's a relevant word that wasn't already taken (*The first page of Google results for `vocally js` produced nothing to do with software at the time I chose it*).

I also liked how I imagined the API methods would sound: `vocally.say()`, `vocally.read()`, `vocally.listen()`.

Finally, I thought it was a node to the Accessibility community, which often uses the numeronym "a11y" (or "ally") as an abbreviation - because I had the idea for this project starting at the Perth Web Accessibility Camp in 2018, and I believe the biggest opportunity for this technology is to make the web inclusive to more people in more ways.
